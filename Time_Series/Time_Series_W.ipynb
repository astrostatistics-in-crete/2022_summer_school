    "For this workshop, we will be using the methods we previously learned to identify periodicity (either exoplanets or eclipsing binaries) in lightcurves from the Kepler space telescope. Kepler stared at the same patch of the sky for years, observing the same stars with a regular cadence of 30 minutes (a subset were observed with a faster cadence). Every few weeks, Kepler would rotate to Earth to beam back down the data it collected. Then it would return to the same field to repeat its observations. \n",

    "The long light curves therefore show gaps in the data. To use Fourier methods with these data, one would need to fill in the gaps with padded data. Fortunately, we are only looking at a small subset of the data, so no large gaps should be present. "
