    "Let's start by imagining that we have a method to measure the distance to a star. As with all observations, there is some uncertainty associated with that measurement. So let's imagine that our particular star is at a distance of 100 pc, and our measurement method allows us a precision of 20 pc. If we were to measure the same star 10,000 separate times, we would find that half the time the star is _observed_ to be nearer than 100 pc, and the other half it is _observed_ to be farther than 100 pc. In fact, the distance distribution will form (by definition) a Gaussian, centered on 100 pc, with a standard deviation of 20 pc.\n",

As long as you can write your prior distribution down, you have a generative model, and your likelihood function is well formed, you can calculate a posterior probability (ignoring the Bayesian evidence). Once having done so, you can solve for the result using a grid search (where you systematically test a range of values), some minimization technique (as was done above), or other methods which we will learn about in the afternoon."
