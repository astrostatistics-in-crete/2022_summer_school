    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction session, we discussed how to find the best-fit line to data. In this model, we found that the least-squares solution is mathematically identical to minimizing $\\chi^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{\\left[ y_i - f(x_i) \\right]^2}{\\sigma^2_{y,i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this session...\n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to extend beyond linear models, to a model of arbitrary complexity. But first, let's look at the equation above. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have the summation: $\\sum_{i=1}^N$. The fact that we are summing over indices implies we have a discreet number of data points. These data are represented by $x_i$ and $y_i$, as well as their uncertainties $\\sigma_{y,i}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x_i)$ in the equation above is where our model comes in. There is no requirement that $f$ be a linear function, only that it is a _generative model_. A generative model means that our model can \"produce\" mock data. In our case, that means that, for a give input $x_i$, our model provides exactly one model output $y_i$. The $\\chi^2$ equation above allows us statistically compare the model output with the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to use $\\chi^2$ minimization techniques, all we need to do is write down a function, $f(x)$ that gives us an output to compare with the observed data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem: fitting a spectral line\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectroscopy, in which we break up the light from an object (star, galaxy, planet, etc.) into its separate wavelengths, is currently, and has been over the past century, a driving technique in astronomy. It allows us to measure the elemental abundances of stars and the star formation histories of galaxies, to give just two examples. It also allows us to measure the properties of a white dwarf, specifically the temperature and surface gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics predicts that a spectral feature ought to be Gaussian in shape. However, in real stars, lines are typically broadened due to two effects that essentially cause a Doppler shift in the line: rotation and pressure (temperature). Rotation is clear: one side of the star is moving toward the observer (blue shift) while the other side is moving away (red shift). Because the gas is pressurized, random motions of the individual molecules with be either toward or away from the observer - the net effect is a broadened line. Pressure broadening produces a Cauchy distribution in the feature (for stars, these are typically absorption features):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi \\gamma \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{x-x_0}{\\gamma} \\right)^2 \\right]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By measuring the broadening ($\\gamma$), one can determine the temperature at the photosphere of a white dwarf. The question is, how do we find the broadening of the line?\n",
